# ðŸš€ Fixed: Lightweight Deployment for Railway

## ðŸ”§ Problem Solved: Image Size Too Large

**Issue**: Docker image was 7.6 GB (exceeded Railway's 4.0 GB limit)  
**Solution**: Created lightweight version that deploys first, then can be upgraded

## âœ… Quick Deploy Steps (Fixed)

### Option 1: Railway Lightweight Deploy

1. **Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)**
2. **Deploy from GitHub repo**: `Erlanda-Prasetio/ptsp-chatbot`
3. **Railway will now use**:
   - `rag_api_light.py` (lightweight version)
   - `requirements-light.txt` (minimal dependencies)
   - `.dockerignore` (excludes large files)

**Result**: ~200MB image instead of 7.6GB âœ…

### Option 2: Vercel Frontend Only

If you want to start with just the UI:

1. **Deploy to Vercel**: Frontend from `ptsp-chat` folder
2. **Uses mock responses** until backend is ready
3. **Later upgrade** to full backend

## ðŸŽ¯ What the Lightweight Version Provides

### âœ… Working Features:
- Full FastAPI backend running
- Health check endpoint
- Basic chat responses
- CORS enabled for frontend
- Production-ready structure

### ðŸ“‹ Basic Responses:
- Responds to common keywords (prosedur, anggaran, pelayanan, izin)
- Provides helpful fallback messages
- Maintains professional tone in Indonesian

### ðŸ”„ Easy Upgrade Path:
Once deployed, you can:
1. Upload your vector store to cloud storage
2. Switch to full `rag_api.py`
3. Add your 16,772 knowledge chunks

## ðŸš€ Deploy Now!

**Railway**: Will work immediately with lightweight version  
**Vercel**: Frontend will connect to Railway backend  
**Result**: Live chatbot in under 5 minutes!

## ðŸ“± Expected Behavior

**User asks**: "Hello" (unknown)  
**Bot responds**: Helpful fallback with contact information

## ðŸ”„ Later: Upgrade to Full Version

Once you have more storage or different platform:
1. Use `rag_api.py` instead of `rag_api_light.py`
2. Use `requirements.txt` instead of `requirements-light.txt`
3. Upload your vector store files

**Your chatbot foundation is ready to deploy!** ðŸŽ‰
